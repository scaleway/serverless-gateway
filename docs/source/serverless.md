# Serverless functions

Routes to [Serverless Functions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/) and [Containers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-containers/) can be added to your gateway just like any other URL, and can be a cost-effective, easy way to deploy APIs.

## Python API framework

If you are building a Python serverless app, you can manage and transparently integrate with your gateway using the [Scaleway Python API framework](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-api-project). This makes building and managing complex serverless APIs easy.

You can see an example using the framework with a gateway in the [API framework examples](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-api-framework-python/tree/main/examples).
